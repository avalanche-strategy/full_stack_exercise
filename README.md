# Avalanche Exercise

In this exercise we're going to be calculating word frequencies using a metric called "Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency" or TFIDF. This metric is a way of measuring the relative importance of a word in a document. Finding these words can give you a sense of what the document is about.

We provide skeleton code, including a function that calculates TFIDF. We also provide two tests. The first is a simple case which can be used to test if your solution can pick out the top word in 3 sentences. The second is a larger test case where we pick out the top 10 words in 10 different books.

# What we're looking for

We are looking to see how you think about the problem. So wherever possible, talk out loud. We will evaluate the code you write primarily on if it can handle the two test cases. That said, we'll also take into consideration how close your code was to producing the correct outputs. We recognize the exercise is time constrained, so don't worry too much about styling or finding the most elegant solution. In general, we don't care about runtime. However, the second test case has a lot of data to traverse, so avoid very slow code as it might time out. You're allowed to use the internet to look up whatever you need, and are encouraged to ask questions.

We'll ask you to screen share while we're going through the exercise. At the end, we'll ask you to zip up your work and send it over.
