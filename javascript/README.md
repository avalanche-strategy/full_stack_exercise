You'll need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed for this project.

Run yarn in this directory to install dependencies.

In this folder you'll find a solution.js file. This is where you'll write your solution. Inside, we have a function for you to write your solution in. We've also provided a test.js file. You can run the two tests with `yarn test`, or if you want the tests to run continuously `yarn test --watch`

You can add more tests to the test.js file, but please don't modify the test data that's already there.
